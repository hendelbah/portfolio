My portfolio
============
There is some projects I have done and want to share

Listed from new to old:

- Web Monaco report
- Unique characters
- Telebot: telegram chat bot
- Cellular automaton: wildfire simulation
- Fractals on Delphi

Web Monaco report
-----------------
This is a project for FoxmindEd Python courses. It is well documented
and covered with tests

There is racing_report subpackage for building the report from particular
files, performed in OOP style

It uses:

- **Flask, Jinja**
- **HTML, CSS**
- **OOP**
- **pytest**

Unique characters

This is a project for FoxmindEd Python courses. It is well documented
and covered with tests(pytest)

It is performed as a python package and has importable utilities and also CLI

It uses:

- **collections**
- **argparse**
- **pytest**

Telebot
-------
.. important::
    **Both this and the next projects I had made before I decided to become a
    professional programmer, also they are not covered with tests.**

The telegram bot I made for managing certain common situations in chat of
employees of chemical factory I used to work at.

It uses:

- **pyTelegramBotAPI**
- **SQL: Sqlite3**
- **OOP**

Cellular automaton
------------------
This was a project for my lab work in university(actually we had some
programing subjects when studied chemistry). The task was to simulate
wildfires using cellular automata model.

It is performed in OOP style and has GUI.

It uses:

- **TKInter**
- **OOP**
- **pillow**

Fractals
------------------
I did this project for fun 2 years ago when i didn't know python, using
Delphi that I had been taught in school.

It was made with Embarcadero RAD studio IDE

I think the application is very fun, hope you'll try it.
