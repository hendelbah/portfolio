My portfolio
============
There is some projects I have done and want to share

Listed from new to old:

- Web Monaco report
- Unique characters
- Telebot: telegram chat bot
- Cellular automaton: wildfire simulation
- Fractals on Delphi

Web Monaco report
-----------------
Web application for showing Monaco 2018 Racing statistics. There is a web interface and restAPI.

This is a project for FoxmindEd Python courses. It is well documented
and covered with tests

It uses:

- **HTML, CSS, SQL**
- **REST API**
- **pytest**

Unique characters

It is performed as a python package and has importable utilities and also CLI

It uses:

- **argparse**
- **pytest**

Telebot
-------
.. important::
    **Both this and the next projects I had made before I decided to become a
    professional programmer, also they are not covered with tests.**

The telegram bot for managing certain common situations in chat of
employees of chemical factory I used to work at.

I had made it just out of interest, but unfortunately it didn't find any real
life application.

It uses:

- **pyTelegramBotAPI**
- **SQL: Sqlite3**
- **OOP**

Cellular automaton
------------------
Application that simulates wildfire using cellular automata model. As the result
is creates GIF file that shows wildfire dynamics.

This was a project for my lab work in university(actually we had some
programing subjects when studied chemistry).

It is performed in OOP style and has GUI.

It uses:

- **TKInter**
- **OOP**
- **pillow**

Fractals
--------
Application with GUI that visualizes Mandelbrot and Julia sets.

I did this project for fun 2 years ago when i didn't know python, using
Delphi I had been taught in school.

It was made with Embarcadero RAD studio IDE, and uses external GifImage
library for saving GIF (it's quite large)
